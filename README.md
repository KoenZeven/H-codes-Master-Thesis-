# H-codes-Master-Thesis-
This repository is meant for my master thesis (from 21-1-2025 until 27-7-2025).
The objective is to find the maximum number of graphs on n vertices such that no two graphs within that family have their symmetric difference contain a graph from a different family H.
To calculate the exact value for different n, we can transform this problem into an independent set problem.
The above is what the H_good_to_indep_set file computes.
